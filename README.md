# Tertis

The objective of this game is to move falling geometric shapes to form complete rows at the bottom of the game board on behalf of user for the purpose of increasing score.

Software Used: To build this game, we have used OpenGL which is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

Implementation: This game is developed using several primitives. All the objects in this project are created by some specific primitives such as GL_LINES, GL_QUADS, and GL_TRIANGLES. We used transform and scale to fit several objects to our favor. To make the game feel more realistic we added sound and animations. For moving objects Left key and Right key were used. For changing Tetris shape down key was used and. Keyword 'S' helps to start the game and Keyword 'R' helps to reset the game.  The game also provides user the convenience to increase the speed of falling Tetris. For relaxation, the game plays background music which can be handled by Keyword 'm'.

Importance: Tetris is a game which is beneficial to brain. It helps to make parts of cerebral cortex thicker and other areas of brain more efficient. It also reduces flashbacks for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. It is a game which appeals to natural desire to organize things, complete tasks and achieve goals. The game gives a constant stream of “incomplete tasks” — there’s always a new block to consider and place in the game, which keeps your brain hooked.

Limitations: The current version of this game bears several improvements which are now limitations. For example, in this version player can maximum play till the score isn't '99'. Scoring more than 99 is a right for the player but we keep it for next version. Another limitation is that the screen isn't visible if the tile matrix is more than 20*20. At the time of falling all the different shapes of tiles are in same color. This can be in different colors.
